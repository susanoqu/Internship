INTERVIEW QUESTIONS



Q1. what is an open port?
Ans.open port is a network port that is configured to accept incoming connections from remote devices.portss are numbersed from 0 to 65535 where 0-1024 are well-knowned and mostley used ports


Q2. How does Nmap perform a TCP SYN scan?
Ans. firstly it send syn packet(request to start connection) then if the target is replied with SYN-ACK that mran the port is open and is replied wirh RST that means port is closed


Q3.What risks are associated with open ports?
Ans.open ports can be entry point for attracker to attack is not secured 


Q4.explain differce between TCP and UDP scanning?
Ans. TCP is connection-oriented protocol and it is faster and more reliable and it use SYN/ACK packets 
 UDP is connectionless protocol and is slower and less relaible and send empty UDP packets


Q5.How can open ports be secured?
Ans. 1.)close unused ports
    2.)update software regularly
     3.) monitor logs for unusal port activity
     
     

Q6.What is firewall role regarding ports?
Ans.firewall control network traffic based on security rules.It blocks or allow traffic to specific ports.It prevents unauthorised access to open ports.

Q7.What is a port scan and why do attacker perform it?
Ans.port scan is a pocess of sending packets to a range of ports on a host to discover which are open,closed,filter.
Attacker perform port scan to:
1.)identify running services and potential vulnerabilities.
2.)determine security measures like firewall ,IDS.

Q8.How does wireshark complement port scanning?
Ans.Wireshark is a packet analyzer that capture and inspect network traffic in real time.it complement port scanning by :
1.)verifying nmap result.
2.)analysis responses to detect filtering or blocking.
